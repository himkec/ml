## What is Machine Learning?

In basic terms, ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions or generate content from data.

## Types of ML Systems
ML systems fall into one or more of the following categories based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Generative AI

### Supervised learning
Supervised learning models can make predictions after seeing lots of data with the correct answers and then discovering the connections between the elements in the data that produce the correct answers. This is like a student learning new material by studying old exams that contain both questions and answers. Once the student has trained on enough old exams, the student is well prepared to take a new exam. These ML systems are "supervised" in the sense that a human gives the ML system data with the known correct results.

#### Regression
A regression model predicts a numeric value. For example, a weather model that predicts the amount of rain, in inches or millimeters, is a regression model.


| Scenario   | Possible input data   | Numeric prediction  |
|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Future house price | Square footage, zip code, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, mortgage interest rate, property tax rate, construction costs, and number of homes for sale in the area. | The price of the home.|
| Future ride time | Historical traffic conditions (gathered from smartphones, traffic sensors, ride-hailing and other navigation applications), distance from destination, and weather conditions. | The time in minutes and seconds to arrive at a destination. |
